# Instrumenting a Chess game with FÐ¯IDA

## Table of contents

* list
{:toc}

In this entry the open-source [DreamChess](https://www.dreamchess.org/) [[LICENSE](https://github.com/dreamchess/dreamchess/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)] game will be reversed and instrumented with [Frida](https://frida.re/). The goal is to simulate a human playing against the game CPU by intercepting the binary's function calls and leveraging existing byte code to input moves. The human agent is simulated through a well known open source chess engine called [StockFish](https://stockfishchess.org/). For this exercise, the binary was reversed as if there is no knowledge of the source code. 

## Requirements

Tools were installed in a Ubuntu machine version 5.4.0-37-generic.

## Static binary analysis

The first step is to understand the characteristics of our target binary (dreamchess). To analyze, radare2 will be used. The binary was loaded, and the basic info was dumped:

```
[0x0000be00]> iI
arch     x86
baddr    0x0
binsz    210516
bintype  elf
bits     64
canary   true
class    ELF64
crypto   false
endian   little
havecode true
intrp    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
laddr    0x0
lang     c
linenum  false
lsyms    false
machine  AMD x86-64 architecture
maxopsz  16
minopsz  1
nx       true
os       linux
pcalign  0
pic      true
relocs   false
relro    full
rpath    NONE
sanitiz  false
static   false
stripped true
subsys   linux
va       true
```

During this analysis, the important aspects to note are the architecture and if the binary has been stripped. Architecture can give us an idea of the [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) which determines the calling convention, and if the binary has been stripped it means that there is no debug information that can aid during debugging and reversing. Unfortunately in this case, as most production binaries, debug symbols have been stripped.

**NOTE:** A description of all the attributes output by `iI` can be found [here](https://dzhy.dev/2020/02/28/Understanding-rabin2-output/).

The next step in the analysis process is to visualize the functions the binary possess. This will help identify calls that can be intercepted to know the state of the board, and that can be used to introduce input to the program. To do this `afl` was used in radare2.
 
```sh
0x0000be00]> afl
0x0000be00    1 46           entry0

0x0001b460   21 839  -> 815  sym.gg_vbox_input
0x0001a8c0    1 16           sym.gg_signal_exit
...
0x00020f40    4 145  -> 140  fcn.00020f40
0x00020fe0    4 107  -> 102  fcn.00020fe0
0x00021050    4 85   -> 80   fcn.00021050
0x00021590    4 75           fcn.00021590
0x00022910    1 89           fcn.00022910
0x00023020    6 259  -> 254  fcn.00023020
0x00022970   64 1359 -> 1310 fcn.00022970
```

Interestingly, even though the binary was stripped there are plenty of functions that map into named symbols. This is because, even though symbols were stripped, these functions are being exported by the binary resulting in this information being exposed. 

As observed with radare2 previously, and with objdump. There are no debug symbols:

```sh
$ objdump --syms /usr/games/dreamchess 

/usr/games/dreamchess:     file format elf64-x86-64

SYMBOL TABLE:
no symbols
```

Although, if the exports are listed, it is possible to observe the functions detected by radare2:

```sh
$ objdump -TC /usr/games/dreamchess 

/usr/games/dreamchess:     file format elf64-x86-64

This is not necessarily a programmer mistake, since there are cases where it is desired to export the functions so other programs can link against and reuse the functionality. But usually executables hide their exports by compiling with `-fvisibility=hidden`. More information on this can be found [here](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility).

This will ease when looking for functions of interest. As an initial naive approach, the export list will be filtered to find functions that contain keywords such as board, move, and game. Since these can give us hints on how a game is created, the board is configured and how to detect movements of the pieces on the board. Which will help instrumenting the binary later on.

Filter exports with "board":
```

```

This approach has been fruitful. As some functions look promising, such as `make_move`, `get_board`, `game_load`, etc. 

Also, there are some other functions, not necessarily related to the movement of the pieces or configuration, such as `san_to_move` that are interesting as well, as they include terms related to chess programming. In this particular one, `san` probably refers to the [standard algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)), which can help translate internal structures to a human-readable form.

## Dynamic binary analysis

Since some functions of interest have already been detected, it is possible to move to a dynamic approach. In this phase [`frida-trace`](https://frida.re/docs/frida-trace/) will be used to understand when different functions of interest are being called.

### Determining piece movements

In order to instrument the binary to play by itself, knowledge of how the program moves the pieces is required. As these calls need to be intercepted when the CPU issues a move and issued when the external engine that simulates the human responding.

To determine this, the program will be interacted with during a chess game session while `frida-trace` is running while filtering for function calls with `move`.

The following command was issued to start tracing:

```sh
$ frida-trace  -i *move* dreamchess
...
62 ms  get_move()
63 ms  game_want_move()
69 ms  draw_move_lists()
69 ms     | game_get_move_list()
78 ms  get_move()
78 ms  game_want_move()
82 ms  draw_move_lists()
...
```

Many function calls are being printed constantly, even without user interaction, probably due to the UI calling these while refreshing the screen. These functions will be excluded from the trace to isolate the ones being called only during user interaction. Resulting in the following command line:

```
frida-trace -i *move*  -x *get_move -x *game_want_move -x *draw_move_lists -x *game_get_move_list -x *_dbus_list_remove_link dreamchess
```

When the CPU moves a piece, it generates the following trace:

```
Started tracing 226 functions. Press Ctrl+C to stop.                    
           /* TID 0x974a */
  8091 ms  san_to_move()
  8091 ms  fullalg_to_move()
  8091 ms     | move_is_valid()
  8091 ms     |    | make_move()
  8091 ms     | move_set_attr()
  8091 ms     |    | make_move()
  8091 ms     |    | move_is_valid()
  8091 ms     |    | move_is_valid()

```

This was achieved by starting a game where the CPU plays as whites (plays first).

![](https://i.imgur.com/tD5yNu5.png)

Now the inverse will be done. A new chess game will be started where the user plays the first move.

After the first piece is move, it is possible to see the following trace:

```
 23874 ms  game_make_move()
 23874 ms     | move_is_valid()
 23874 ms     |    | make_move()
 23874 ms     | move_set_attr()
 23874 ms     |    | make_move()
...
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/Rsd9D9t.png)

By comparing these two, it is possible to see that `san_to_move` is called only when the CPU issues a move, and `game_make_move` when the human moves.

#### Identifying CPU piece movements

The next step is to identify when a CPU movement is completed. So when instrumenting the binary a callback can be set to respond to the movement issued by the game. 

To understand this, a GDB session will be attached to the game process, and as a starting point, a breakpoint will be set in `san_to_move` as this function is only called during CPU piece movements.

```
$ ps -au | grep dreamchess
     38730  360  2.4 2136836 196628 pts/3  Rl+  Jun19 7076:14 /usr/games/dreamchess
     49888  0.0  0.5  59264 40352 pts/2    S+   11:12   0:02 r2 /usr/games/dreamchess
     52224  0.0  0.0  17664   736 pts/5    S+   13:45   0:00 grep --color=auto dreamchess
$ gdb -pid 38730
...
b san_to_move
```

By doing multiple moves, it is possible to appreciate that only when the CPU starts a movement this breakpoint is hit, inline to what is observed with `frida-trace`. 

Although by the end of the execution of this function call, the piece is not yet moved on the board. This can be appreciated by hitting the breakpoint and continuing to the end of the function by issuing a `fin` gdb command.

![](https://i.imgur.com/RIDTj8S.png)

Additional to this, it seems that the function is directly called from `main`, as seen in the image above. In order to understand when a move is finalized, `main` will be disassembled around `san_to_move` function call, to understand the next steps the program is taking and analyze them dynamically with GDB to appreciate when a CPU movement is completed.

To ease the disassembly, radare2 was used:

There are a couple of familiar functions in this disassembly. For example, after calling `san_to_move` the binary might jump to `0x0000bbc5` where `fullalg_to_move` is called, similar to what was observed in `frida-trace`. Then, when successful, it jumps back and executes from instruction `0x0000bba4` and calls into `audio_play_sound` and `fcn.0000dc40`. 

As an initial approach gdb will be used to single-step through main after the execution of `san_to_move`.

```

At the end of the function `0x000055852612cc40`, the piece was finally moved. This function corresponds to `fcn.0000dc40` mentioned above. This can be proved by subtracting the offset of the module to the function address:

```
(gdb) info proc map 
process 38730
Mapped address spaces:

          Start Addr           End Addr       Size     Offset objfile
      0x55852611f000     0x558526129000     0xa000        0x0 /usr/games/dreamchess
...
(gdb) p/x 0x000055852612cc40 - 0x55852611f000
$1 = 0xdc40
```

As seen above the offset matches to what radare2 indicated as function name. 

As the next step, this call will be monitored with `frida-trace`, to understand when it is called. 

```
frida-trace -a dreamchess\!0xdc40 dreamchess
```

By interacting with the system. It seems that this function is called any time a piece is moved from either side (human, CPU). 

![](https://i.imgur.com/wUN0Ipm.png)

This function can be intercepted to know when a move is completed. Afterward, based on the ordering of the moves, it is possible to determine if the move was done by the CPU or the human.

#### Initiating moves

The next step is to find a function that can be instrumented to send moves to the program. This to simulate the human playing against the machine.

From the initial `frida-trace`, it was determined that every time a user moves a piece the function `game_make_move` was called. Based on the name it seems to be a way of issuing piece movements.

By using gdb it is possible to call functions defined in the binary, although these might require arguments. To find if they do, and what they might be, radare2 can be used to both disassemble the function and find cross-references that indicate the usage.

As an initial step, radare2 will be used to dissasemble the function:

Radare2 already shows the signature that it expects the function to have`sym.game_make_move (int64_t arg1);`). By going through the function, it seems to be calling the function `fcn.0000dc40` mentioned in the previous section. This further indicates that `game_make_move` could be the function used by the user to initiate a move.

Cross references of `game_make_move` can help understanding the parameter that it receives:

```
[0x0000dfc0]> axt sym.game_make_move
sym.game_make_move_str 0xe23e [CALL] call sym.game_make_move
fcn.00024660 0x24840 [CALL] call sym.game_make_move
```

By looking at `game_make_move_str` dissasemble it is possible to know how `game_make_move` is called:

By looking at the disassembly, it can be observed that the return value of `san_to_move` is passed as the first argument of `game_make_move` if it is not 0. Otherwise, the return value of `fullalg_to_move` is passed as input, as long it is not zero either. If both functions `san_to_move` and `fullalg_to_move` return 0 an error message is printed.

By just analyzing the name of the `san_to_move` function, it can be inferred that it takes a move in [SAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation) notation, and transforms to an internal representation of a `move`. By disassembling the function, it is possible to gain a better understanding of what it does:

It seems that the first argument of the function (`rdi`), is a pointer to the heap that contains some unknown structure. The second argument (`rsi`) is a pointer to the heap, containing a string that represents the move made by the CPU ("g1f3"). Although it is not in SAN notation, it is in coordinate notation. The return value is `0`, maybe denoting failure or an invalid pointer.

In this case, as stated previously the program will continue and call `fullalg_to_move`, which by paying a closer look at the disassembly of `game_make_move_str` is taking the same arguments as `san_to_move`. By setting a breakpoint in this function it is possible to see that this one returns a valid pointer, which is then given to `game_make_move`:

```

By knowing this, it is possible to simulate a call to`game_make_move` by first using `fullalg_to_move` to transform a move represented in coordinate notation to a consumable pointer. But before doing this, the first argument of `fullalg_to_move` needs to be understood.

By making an educated guess, to generate a move the state of the board plus the move representation is needed (as you need to translate the coordinates from the coordinate notation to actual board pieces). Since the move representation is already given as the second parameter, probably the first is a pointer to a struct that represents the state of the board.

From the list of externs obtained in the "Static binary analysis" section, there is a function called `get_board`, which might be promising to get such struct.

By disassembling this function in radare2, it can be observed that it receives no arguments and returns a pointer.

```

```

Knowing all this, it is possible to attempt to move one of the pieces by doing the following:

1. Obtain the board pointer by calling `get_board`.
2. Allocate memory to store the move representation string.
3. Set the move to be issued.
4. Call `fullalg_to_move` to obtain a pointer to the move to be made.
5. Call `game_make_move` to issue the user move.

This was done in gdb to prototype:

```
call (uint64_t*)get_board()
call (uint64_t*)malloc(25)
set {char[5]}$2 = "e2e4"
call (uint64_t*)fullalg_to_move($1, $2)
call (uint64_t*)game_make_move($3)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/eJS0B9M.png)

The piece was moved by issuing these gdb commands as seen in the image above.

#### Understanding CPU moves

From section "Identifying CPU piece movements" it was stated that each time a piece is moved in the board the function `fcn.0000dc40` is called. By looking at the function call in `main`, additional information such as the arguments passed to the function can be known:

```

In this case, by looking at the disassembly, it is possible to observe that the return value of `san_to_move` and `fullalg_to_move` is passed to `fcn.0000dc40` as first argument and `1` as the second argument. 

From section "Initiating moves" it was determined that `san_to_move` and `fullalg_to_move` return a pointer representing a move that was translated from either san (standard arithmetic notation) or coordinate notation.

From the exports, it is possible to find the inverse of these functions: `move_to_san` and `move_to_fullalg`. 

`move_to_fullalg` seems to be a better choice to decypher the internal move representation, as chess engines prefer this form of notation. By using radare2 it is possible to extract the arguments to the function:

From this cross reference found in `game_make_move`, it is possible to see that the second parameter passed to `move_to_fullalg` is the first argument given to `game_make_move`, which as seen in the previous section is the internal representation of a move.

Similar to their counterpart, it is probable that `move_to_fullalg` required the state of the board to do a transformation between move representations. This can be verified by instrumenting the call in gdb:

```
(gdb) call (uint64_t*)get_board()
$2 = (uint64_t *) 0x56202b11dbc0
(gdb) call (uint64_t*)move_to_fullalg($2, $rdi)
$3 = (uint64_t *) 0x56202c3e3480
(gdb) x/s 0x56202c3e3480
0x56202c3e3480:    "b1c3"
```

This seems to prove the stated hypothesis.

### Determining initial game state

In order to find out if the CPU player is going to make the first move, i.e; if Dreamchess CPU is playing with the white pieces, it is imperative to find which function is in charge of setting up the configurations selected in the game menu, such as the type of players, difficulty, and level: 

![](https://i.imgur.com/vW4sRA2.png)

To achieve this `frida-trace` was used. `frida-trace` provides different options to make the tracing more granular, to exclude or include specific functions, for example. As explained before, since most videogames use a graphical interface, it is inherent that many functions related to the GUI (Graphical User Interface) such as the renderization and the mouse listeners are constantly called to refresh the game UI, it is better to exclude those calls from the tracing to facilitate the search of the function that provides the configuration of the current game and to include only the `dreamchess` module. In addition to facilitate the search of the target function, frida will perform better when using a more granular specification for the tracing.

```sh
$ frida-trace -I dreamchess -x "gg_*" -x "*draw*" -x "yy*" -x "*gl*"  -x "*mouse*" -x "*screen*" -x "*text_character*" -x "*ui*" dreamchess 
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/nLdEPXs.png)

Even after excluding several functions related to the GUI and user interaction, there are still plenty of functions being traced. To reduce the number of functions to analyze, the tracing was performed twice in two different contexts. The first tracing was performed without initializing the game (before clicking `Start Game`) and the second one was performed while the game was initialized (before, during, and after clicking `Start Game`). Both of the results from the tracing were written into different files and they were compared using `diff` to see what functions are not present before starting the game.

```sh 
#### Before initializing the game 
$ frida-trace -I dreamchess -x "gg_*" -x "*draw*" -x "yy*" -x "*gl*"  -x "*mouse*" -x "*screen*" -x "*text_character*" dreamchess > before_start.txt
$ cat before_start.txt | grep ms | awk {'print $3'} | sort | uniq > before_start_clean.txt
$
#### After initializing the game 
$ frida-trace -I dreamchess -x "gg_*" -x "*draw*" -x "yy*" -x "*gl*"  -x "*mouse*" -x "*screen*" -x "*text_character*" dreamchess > after_start.txt
$ cat after_start.txt | grep ms | awk {'print $3'} | sort | uniq > after_start_clean.txt
$
### Diffing the files
$ diff before_start_clean.txt after_start_clean.txt
```
As a result, a reduced set of functions was obtained. This set of functions could be seen as a snapshot of the functions running at the time of initializing a new game:

```sh 
0a1,2

Based on the name of the functions, an educated guess to dismiss some of them was made, for instance, the ones related to the function that reproduces a sound when a new game starts or the function that is constantly looking for a checkmate, and so forth. One of the functions that stand out was `dialog_title_newgame_create()` essentially because it contained references to strings that are used in the game's menu just before initializing a game, such as `"Players"`, `"Difficulty"` and `"Level"`.

After that function is executed, some functions related to seting up the configuration of the game are executed:

```

After those functions are executed, the game starts rendering and setting up the parameters set in the dialog menu using the functions `config_get_option()` and `get_config`. The function `get_config` is self-explanatory, it just reads from an object called `config`.

```sh

By attaching a gdb session to the running process (`gdb -p <PID>`), setting up a breakpoint in the function `get_config` (`(gdb) b get_config`) and then continuing the program until the function is called, it is possible to analyze the contents of the object:

> The function `get_config` is called several times before starting the game, but the important one is the last call since, at that moment, the object contains all the configuration parameters, so the hexdump show below was made after the last time `get_config`


For the configuration `Players: Human vs CPU, Difficulty: Normal, Level: 1`

```sh
0x55b609af1090 <config>:    0x00000000    0x00000001    0x00000000    0x00000001
```
For the configuration `Players: CPU vs Human, Difficulty: Normal, Level: 3`

```sh
0x55b609af1090 <config>:    0x00000001    0x00000000    0x00000000    0x00000003
```
For the configuration `Players: Human vs Human, Difficulty: Normal, Level: 5`

```sh
0x55b609af1090 <config>:    0x00000000    0x00000000    0x00000000    0x00000005
```

The first two 4-byte words change depending on the *Players* setting. If the first 4-byte word is `0x0` and the second 4-byte word is `0x1`, it means that the `Human` is going to play with the white pieces. Likewise,  If the first 4-byte word is `0x1` and the second 4-byte word is `0x0`, it means that the `Human` is going to play with the black pieces. By understanding, the goal to know if the Dreamchess CPU is playing with the white pieces or with the black pieces, has been accomplished. This is going to be very useful when instrumenting the game later.

## Interacting with chess engines

Most of the chess engines implement [UCI](https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI) (Universal Chess Interface). And some engines expose a UCI command-line interface, such as the case of StockFish. Through UCI you can request a chess engine to calculate the best possible moves based on the state of the board.

There are two different ways to represent the state of a board in a UCI compliant chess engine. Either through [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) (ForsythâEdwards Notation) or a list of coordinate notated moves.

In this case, as the functions that were found can translate internal representations into coordinate notated moves, the second approach will be done. 

To exemplify this, a simple set of commands will be sent to StockFish to request for the next move:

```
uci  
position startpos moves e2e4 d7d6
go ponder
stop
```
In this case, with the `uci` command the engine is started. With `position startpos e2e4 d7d6`, it is indicated that the position to be evaluated is from a start position move the piece in `e2` to `e4`, then move `d7` to `d6`. Then `go ponder` indicated the engine to analyze the current position and `stop` to finish calculating and return an answer.

```

There are many wrappers for integrating StockFish into diverse programming languages. As Frida is usually run through Python scripts, PyPI StockFish was used.

The previous example can be done in a python script as follows:

```
$ python3
Python 3.8.2 (default, Apr 27 2020, 15:53:34) 
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
>>> from stockfish import Stockfish
>>> 
>>> stockfish = Stockfish("/usr/games/stockfish")
>>> stockfish.set_position(['e2e4', 'd7d6'])
>>> print(stockfish.get_best_move_time(1000))
d2d4

```

## Instrumenting with Frida  

Frida is a dynamic code instrumentation toolkit that lets you inject snippets of JavaScript into binaries. It allows debugging with full access to memory, it is able to intercept function calls and execute native functions inside the process. Frida injects the javascript engine [duktape](https://duktape.org/) to accomplish those tasks. More details about Frida's API can be found on its official [website](https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/) 

The next JS was used to make possible the instrumentation of Dreamchess and make it play against a crafted agent, which uses Stockfish to determine the best moves to play.

```js
var next_move = "" // Used to store the asynchronous value returned by the python script
var ptr_mem_fullalg = Memory.alloc(32) // Allocate memory to store the string representation given by the Python script
var reset = 0; // Used to know if a new game has started

// Pointers to the functions that are going to be used
var ptr_move = Process.getModuleByName("dreamchess").base.add(0xdc40); // Function to intercept the movement of a piece
var ptr_game_make_move = Module.findExportByName(null, "game_make_move"); // This function is used by Dreamchess to recieve movements from the user, in this case, the movements are going to be passed from StockFish
var ptr_get_board = Module.findExportByName(null, "get_board"); // It returns the current board.
var ptr_fullalg_to_move = Module.findExportByName(null, "fullalg_to_move"); // Transforms strings in the notation used by StockFish (coordinate notation) into a dreamchess struct 
var ptr_move_to_fullalg = Module.findExportByName(null, "move_to_fullalg"); //T he move made by dreamchess is converted into an coordinate notation to be processed by StockFish (or other engines)
var ptr_history_init = Module.findExportByName(null, "history_init");// It is called every time a new game is initialized
var ptr_get_config = Module.findExportByName(null, "get_config"); // It returns the configuration of the current game
var ptr_game_want_move = Module.findExportByName(null, "game_want_move");// The function is called when the board has been set up and it is ready be played. It is only going to be used when "Human" player is playing with the White pieces

// NativeFunction wrapper of the functions previously defined as function pointers
var fn_game_make_move = new NativeFunction(ptr_game_make_move, 'pointer', ['pointer', 'pointer']); 
var fn_get_board = new NativeFunction(ptr_get_board, 'pointer', []); 
var fn_fullalg_to_move = new NativeFunction(ptr_fullalg_to_move, 'pointer', ['pointer', 'pointer']);
var fn_move_to_fullalg = new NativeFunction(ptr_move_to_fullalg, 'pointer', ['pointer', 'pointer']);
var fn_get_config = new NativeFunction(ptr_get_config, 'pointer', []);

// Intercept history_init to notify the engine that it needs to reset the board, and to indicate a new game has started
Interceptor.attach(ptr_history_init,
{
    onLeave: function (retval) 
    {   
        send("reset");
        reset = 1; // Set the reset flag, as this is a new game
    }
});

// Intercept the first call to game_want_move. Check if user is playing as whites and issue the first move
Interceptor.attach(ptr_game_want_move,
{
    onLeave: function (retval) 
    {   
        // Game is set up
        if (reset)
        {
            
            var config = fn_get_config();//The function that reads the object config
            var whiteCPU = config.readUInt() //Read the first 4 bytes, if it contains a 0x1, then CPU is playing with White pieces
            var blackCPU = config.add(4).readUInt() //Read the next 4 bytes, if it contains a 0x1, then CPU is playing with Black pieces
            console.log("Started game! CPU Whites? " + whiteCPU); //If CPU is playing with white pieces, prints 1 otherwise prints 0

            // If CPU is playing with Blacks, Human starts
            if (blackCPU)
            {
                send(""); // Send an empty move to make StockFish return a move 
                recv(get_move).wait(); //wait until receive a move from stockfish
                
                var board = fn_get_board(); // Since StockFish, playing as Human in this scneario, the board is needed.  
                ptr_mem_fullalg.writeUtf8String(next_move); // The move is written into the memory allocated previously
                var ptr_next_move = fn_fullalg_to_move(board, ptr_mem_fullalg); // fn_fullalg_to_move transforms from coordinate notation into a struct used by Dreamchess
                console.log(ptr_next_move); // Prints the move that is going to be made
                fn_game_make_move(ptr_next_move, board); // Actually makes the move
            }
            // Catch the error in case the game mode was set as Human vs Human
            else if (!whiteCPU && !blackCPU)
            {
                console.log("Human vs Human? ... Nothing to do here");
            }
            reset = 0; // To avoid this function is called again unless a new game starts
        }
    }
});

// Intercept calls when a piece is moved. Since 'user' moves are instrumented by Frida, only CPU calls are intercepted.
Interceptor.attach(ptr_move, 
{
    onEnter: function (args) 
    {
        var board = fn_get_board();
        var ptr_move = fn_move_to_fullalg(board, args[0]); // Transforms from Dreamches notation into coordinate notation
        var current_move = ptr_move.readUtf8String(); // Reads the movement from Dreamchess that has already been transformed into coordinate notation that later is going to be send to StockFish
        send(current_move); // Send the move to StockFish
        this.recv_wait = recv(get_move); // Store the recv object to avoid busy waiting state
    },
    onLeave: function (retval) 
    {
        var board = fn_get_board(); //The board information needs to be requested again since the state of the board has changed since a move has just been made
        this.recv_wait.wait(); //Wait until StockFish responds with a move

        ptr_mem_fullalg.writeUtf8String(next_move); //Write the move given by StockFish into the buffer 
        var ptr_next_move = fn_fullalg_to_move(board, ptr_mem_fullalg); //fn_fullalg_to_move transforms from coordinate notation into a struct for Dreamchess
        fn_game_make_move(ptr_next_move, board); // Makes the move
    }
});

// Callback when python provides a move to be made
function get_move(m)
{
    next_move =  m //The movement is saved
}
```

Frida also implements a Python API to perform bindings. Since there is a straight forward Stockfish API in Python, as mentioned in the previous section, a python agent was created to load the JS script into the dreamchess process and handle transactions to the external chess engine. 

```py 
# Imports the libraries, frida and stockfish for Python
import frida
import sys
from stockfish import Stockfish
# Path to engine
stockfish = Stockfish("/usr/games/stockfish")
# Define a list to store the moves from the current game
moves = []

# Read the agent source
with open("chess.js", "r") as f:agent = f.read()
# Create a session frida 
session = frida.attach("dreamchess")
# Create a script and loads it into frida
script = session.create_script(agent)
script.load()

# Receives a function from the JS script
def incoming(message, data):
    print(message['payload'])
    # If it is performing a reset, it will clean the "moves" list
    if message['payload'] == "reset": 
        moves.clear()
    # Otherwise, it is sending a move
    else:
        # Appends the new move to the list
        moves.append(message['payload'])
        # All the moves made so far are going to be sent to StockFish
        stockfish.set_position(moves)
        # Analyzes the move that was played by the oponent during 1 second and returns the best move according to StockFish
        move = stockfish.get_best_move_time(1000)
        # Appends the issued move to the list
        moves.append(move)
        print(move)
        # Sends the move to the JS agent injected in the process
        script.post(move)
        
# Every time Frida sends a message, it shall call the "incoming" function
script.on("message", incoming)

# Block so that the program does not quit.
sys.stdin.read()
```
